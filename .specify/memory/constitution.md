# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
[Vacation Rating Site Constitution]

## Core Principles

### I. Account-Based Access
All users must register and authenticate to access site features. Anonymous actions are not permitted.

### II. Vacation Rating
Users can rate vacations. Ratings are tied to user accounts and each user can rate a vacation only once.

### III. Minimal Data Collection
Only essential information is collected: user credentials, vacation details, and ratings. No unnecessary personal data.

### IV. Transparency
All ratings are visible to authenticated users. Vacation details and aggregate ratings are public within the site.

### V. Simplicity
Features are limited to registration, authentication, vacation listing, and rating. No extra functionality unless essential.

## Security Requirements
Passwords must be securely stored (hashed). User sessions must be protected. No sharing of sensitive data.

## Development Workflow
All code changes require review. Basic tests for registration, authentication, rating, and vacation listing are mandatory.
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
