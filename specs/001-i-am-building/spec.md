# Feature Specification: Homely Vacation Rating Site

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a vacation rating site. I want it to look homely and cozy, something more down to earth. The main attraction should of course be viewing vacation spots, where relevant information about each location will be shown in a subroute. This is also where users will be able to bookmark or rate the locations. Users must first be logged into an account to do either of these actions, but even if they don't have an account, they are still free to view the vacation spots. Users will also be able to see their account details, including looking over their past bookmarks and ratings. The vacation spot data will be mocked - you do not need to pull any info about real vacation sites for the time being."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor arrives at the site and browses vacation spots. They can view details about each spot. If they wish to bookmark or rate a spot, they must log in or create an account. Once logged in, they can bookmark or rate vacation spots, and view their account details including past bookmarks and ratings.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they browse vacation spots, **Then** they can view all spot details but cannot bookmark or rate.
2. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they view a vacation spot, **Then** they can bookmark or rate the spot.
3. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they visit their account page, **Then** they see their bookmarks and ratings.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to bookmark or rate without being logged in? (Prompt to log in)
- How does the system handle duplicate bookmarks or ratings? (Prevent duplicates)
- What if vacation spot data is unavailable? (Show error or fallback message)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
**FR-001**: System MUST allow users to view vacation spots and details without logging in.
**FR-002**: System MUST require users to log in before bookmarking or rating vacation spots.
**FR-003**: System MUST allow users to create an account and log in.
**FR-004**: System MUST allow logged-in users to bookmark vacation spots.
**FR-005**: System MUST allow logged-in users to rate vacation spots.
**FR-006**: System MUST show users their account details, including bookmarks and ratings.
**FR-007**: System MUST use mocked data for vacation spots. No real data integration required.
**FR-008**: System MUST prevent users from bookmarking or rating the same spot more than once.
**FR-009**: System MUST display relevant information about each vacation spot in a subroute.
**FR-010**: System MUST provide a homely and cozy visual design, using simple and comfortable elements such as warm earthy colors, minimalist aesthetic, and avoiding screen crowding.
**FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users via email and password. Emails and passwords must be securely stored.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
**User**: Represents a site visitor or account holder. Attributes: username, password, bookmarks, ratings.
**Vacation Spot**: Represents a location to be viewed, bookmarked, or rated. Attributes: name, description, images, mocked details.
**Bookmark**: Represents a user's saved vacation spot. Attributes: user, vacation spot, timestamp.
