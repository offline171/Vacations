CREATE TABLE images (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    vacation_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_vacation FOREIGN KEY (vacation_id) REFERENCES vacation_spots(id),
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    priority BOOLEAN
);

Make sure urls end in jpg or add it to the end of it when displaying it like
    var imgURL = rating[i].url + ".jpg"
priority is to determine what shows up first, and might also be used for the thumbnail
    in the vacations list
This is the order in postgresql, but put url and priority after name and before the timestamps
in inserts for better readability.
