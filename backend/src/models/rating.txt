// Rating model
// TODO: Define rating schema and validation
CREATE TABLE ratings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    user_name VARCHAR(50),
    vacation_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_vacation FOREIGN KEY (vacation_id) REFERENCES vacation_spots(id),
    review INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    comment TEXT
);

This is the order in the database, I suggest putting comment
after review and before the timestamps when inserting with column
names given, since those can be in any order as long as they have
corresponding values.
